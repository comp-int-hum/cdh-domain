We distinguish three fundamental empirical categories that precede or develop along with computational research:

<ul>
  <li>Primary sources</li>
  <li>Domain structure and meaning</li>
  <li>Scholarly knowledge and annotation</li>
</ul>

Since these typically refer to one another, and to the broader range of human knowledge, we represent each of them as Resource Description Framework graphs.
