    <a href="https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf">Topic modeling</a> is an unsupervised machine learning method that learns coherent patterns of word use from how they co-occur within documents.  This is called <emph>distributional semantics</emph>, the idea that things occurring in similar contexts tend to me similar to one another.

    The <i>unsupervised</i> aspect is in contrast to methods that rely on experts in the source material to directly assemble lexicons, a painstaking and potentially biased process.  However, such human knowledge is the gold standard foundation of focused analysis, and can still take advantage of the straightforward ability of computers to apply such lexicons to large-scale sources.

    This interface allows you to upload primary source documents, create and apply both topic models and lexicons, and inspect the results for insight.

    If you log into the site, and browse to "Interaction > Manage", you can upload documents, train topic models, and apply them to other documents.  Below, you can inspect the results of topic modeling, both from the model and document perspectives.
